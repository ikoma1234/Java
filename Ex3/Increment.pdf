   public static void main(String[] args){
     int i = 3;
     i++;
     System.out.println(i); // "4"
     ++i;
     System.out.println(i); // "5"
     System.out.println(++i); // "6"
     System.out.println(i++); // "6"
     System.out.println(i); // "7"
   }

}

First print, i++ means i=i+1 so i became 3 to 4.
Second print, ++i means still i=i+1 so i became 4 to 5.
third print, println(++i) means i=i+1 then print(i) so i became 5 to 6 and 6 is out.           
fourth print, println(i++) means print(i) then i=i+1 so 6 is out then i became 6 to 7.

this is why 6 printed twice.
